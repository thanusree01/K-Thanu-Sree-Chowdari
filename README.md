## Calculator Using Class
## Description
A simple calculator implemented using a Python class that performs **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division**.
## Programming Language
- Python
## Key Features
- Takes two numbers `a` and `b` as input.
- Performs the operation specified (`Addition`, `Subtraction`, `Multiplication`, `Division`).
- Handles division by zero.
## Comments / Notes
- Use `float` for inputs to handle decimal numbers.
- The operation type input is case-insensitive.

# Odd Numbers Series Generator

## Description
Generates a series of the first `a` odd numbers using a class-based Python program.

## Programming Language
HTML + JavaScript

## Key Features
- Input: single integer `a`.
- Output: the first `a` odd numbers.
- Uses formula `2*i + 1` for generating odd numbers.

## Comments / Notes
User enters a number in an input box.
Output is dynamically displayed on the page.
Uses a JavaScript class to generate the series.
Handles both first a odd numbers and largest odd ≤ a scenarios.

# Odd Number Series Generator (Largest Odd ≤ a)

## Description
Generates all odd numbers up to the **largest odd number less than or equal to the user input `a`**.  
Implemented as an **interactive HTML + JavaScript web page** where the user enters a number and the series is displayed dynamically.

## Programming Language
- HTML + JavaScript

## Key Features
- User enters a single integer `a` in an input box.
- If `a` is odd → output includes all odd numbers up to `a`.
- If `a` is even → output includes all odd numbers up to `a - 1`.
- Series is displayed dynamically in the web page.

## Comments / Notes
- Uses a JavaScript class to generate the series.
- Input validation ensures only positive integers are accepted.

# Odd Number Series Generator (Largest Odd ≤ a)

## Description
Generates all odd numbers up to the **largest odd number less than or equal to the user input `a`**.  
Implemented as an **interactive HTML + JavaScript web page** where the user enters a number and the series is displayed dynamically.

## Programming Language
- HTML + JavaScript

## Key Features
- User enters a single integer `a` in an input box.
- If `a` is odd → output includes all odd numbers up to `a`.
- If `a` is even → output includes all odd numbers up to `a - 1`.
- Series is displayed dynamically in the web page.

## Comments / Notes
- Uses a JavaScript class to generate the series.
- Input validation ensures only positive integers are accepted.

  # Count Multiples in a List

## Description
Counts how many numbers in a user-provided list are divisible by each number from **1 to 9**.  
Implemented as a **Python console application** where the user enters numbers at runtime.

## Programming Language
- Python

## Key Features
- User inputs a list of integers separated by spaces.
- Outputs a dictionary showing counts for each divisor from 1 to 9.
- Handles dynamic input from the user.
